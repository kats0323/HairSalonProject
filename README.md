**An example of our App architecture Diagram**

Customer will fill in the form which contains date, hour, full name, phone and more. Once the User hits the submit button on the page it will send a post request to the server which will then send the data to the database it will also send a email to the customer to let them know about the booking they have made. The data that is kept in booking info and report will be sent to admin domain service to be displayed to the admin.

Admin will be able to access the admin domain service through the login page which will require them to fill in username as well as password once they press the submit button it will send a post request which will check the database and compare if the information they have entered to see if it has matched any of the existing data and will be redirected to the admin domain service.

When an admin cancels a previous booking it will send a post request with a different method called delete which will remove the existing data from the database it will also send an email or MSG to the user letting them know that their reservation or booking has been cancelled.
